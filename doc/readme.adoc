= Simple Domain Irrotational Model
Kentaro Hanson
:stem:

This is a Matlab implementation of the Boundary Element Method (BEM) for modeling irrotational fluid flows on a two dimensional simple domain in the context of surface gravity waves. The boundary is restricted to a union of an unmoving Neumann boundary (walls and floor of a tank or basin) and a contiguous free surface (water surface), in the formulation of Grilli et. al.

This model was created for the purpose of modeling shoaling waves, however it is general enough to handle different simulations, such as a standing wave in a tank.

== Running the model

There are 3 simulations already set up in the `examples` directory.
